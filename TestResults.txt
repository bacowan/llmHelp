Note: Should also do the same test as "validation", just to see how it behaves with the new framework and without the validation step.

Things I noticed:
It seems to preform better if the student is more lost, as if if can get them 90% of the way there, but if the student is already 90% of the way there then it has a bit of trouble helping them.
