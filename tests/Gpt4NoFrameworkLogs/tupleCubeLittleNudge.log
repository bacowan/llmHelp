{"level":"info","message":"It seems there's a small mistake in your code snippet. Your intention is to create a list of tuples where the second element is the cube of the number. However, in your list comprehension, you are multiplying the value by 3 (`val * 3`) instead of cubing it. To obtain the cube of a number, you should raise the number to the power of 3 using the `**` operator in Python. \n\nHere's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]\n\n# using list comprehension to iterate each\n# values in list and create a tuple as specified\nres = [(val, val ** 3) for val in list1]\n\n# print the result\nprint(res)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the cube of each number and produce the expected output, where each tuple contains the original number and its cube:\n\n```\n[(1, 1), (2, 8), (5, 125), (6, 216)]\n```","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:19:40.879Z"}
