{"level":"info","message":"It looks like there's an issue with your code because the variable `size` is not defined within the function `swapList`. You are trying to use it to access the last element of the list, but since it's not defined, it will lead to a NameError.\n\nA corrected version of your function is provided below. In this version, I will directly use the `len()` function to find the size of the list and make sure each part is correctly defined within the function:\n\n```python\ndef swapList(newList):\n    if len(newList) > 1:  # Check if swapping is possible\n        temp = newList[0]\n        newList[0] = newList[-1]\n        newList[-1] = temp\n     \n    return newList\n\n# Example usage:\nlist1 = [12, 35, 9, 56, 24]\nprint(swapList(list1))\n\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(swapList(list2))\n```\n\nThis code corrects the error by ensuring all variables are defined and utilized properly within the function. It also uses Python's negative indexing to access the last element of the list (`newList[-1]`), making the code more concise. Additionally, I added a check to ensure the list has more than one element, as swapping in a single-element list is not meaningful.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:02:31.062Z"}
