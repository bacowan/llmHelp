{"level":"info","message":"You're correct, the function you've written uses iteration instead of recursion to compute the power. To achieve the desired recursive approach, you can rewrite the `pow` function by defining a base case and a recursive case that progressively reduces the problem size. Here's how you can implement it using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef pow_recursive(n, p):\n    # Base case: any number to the power of 0 is 1\n    if p == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n^p = n * n^(p-1)\n    else:\n        return n * pow_recursive(n, p-1)\n```\n\nThis version of the function works by repeatedly calling itself with `p` decreased by 1, until `p` reaches 0, at which point it returns 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). Each recursive call multiplies `n` by the result of the next recursive call, effectively computing `n^p`.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For `pow_recursive(2, 3)`, the function computes `2 * pow_recursive(2, 2)`.\n- Then, `pow_recursive(2, 2)` computes `2 * pow_recursive(2, 1)`.\n- `pow_recursive(2, 1)` computes `2 * pow_recursive(2, 0)`.\n- Finally, `pow_recursive(2, 0)` returns `1`, and all the recursive calls return their results back up the chain, ultimately computing `2 * 2 * 2 * 1 = 8`.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:05:28.478Z"}
