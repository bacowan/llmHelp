{"level":"info","message":"Your code snippet currently multiplies each value by 3 instead of raising it to the power of 3 (cubing it) to create the tuples. To achieve the desired effect—where the first element is the number from your list (`list1`), and the second element is that number cubed—you need to modify the comprehension part of your code.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]\n\n# Using list comprehension to iterate each\n# values in list and create a tuple where the second element is the cube of the value\nres = [(val, val ** 3) for val in list1]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(res)\n```\n\nThis revision uses `**` (the power operator in Python) to cube the value (`val ** 3`) for each element in `list1` when creating the tuples in `res`.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:22:10.932Z"}
