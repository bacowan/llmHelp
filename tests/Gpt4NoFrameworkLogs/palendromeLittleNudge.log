{"level":"info","message":"To complete your function for checking the symmetry of a string, you can use a similar approach to what you've done with the palindrome check. You need to compare the first half of the string with the second half. If both halves are identical, then the string is symmetrical. \n\nHere's how you can complete the `symmetry` function:\n\n```python\ndef symmetry(a):\n    n = len(a)\n    flag = 0\n\n    # If the length is odd, we ignore the middle character and check the halves.\n    if n % 2:\n        mid = n // 2 + 1\n    else:\n        mid = n // 2\n\n    start1 = 0\n    start2 = mid\n\n    while(start1 < mid and start2 < n):\n        if (a[start1] == a[start2]):\n            start1 = start1 + 1\n            start2 = start2 + 1\n        else:\n            flag = 1\n            break\n\n    if flag == 0:\n        print(\"The entered string is symmetrical\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The entered string is not symmetrical\")\n\n# Test the functions with examples\ndef main():\n    str1 = \"khokho\"\n    print(\"Input:\", str1)\n    palindrome(str1)\n    symmetry(str1)\n\n    str2 = \"amaama\"\n    print(\"\\nInput:\", str2)\n    palindrome(str2)\n    symmetry(str2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nIn the `symmetry` function, the approach is to divide the string into two equal halves (if the string length is odd, the middle character is ignored). Then, compare the characters of the first half with the corresponding characters in the second half in a sequential manner. If all the characters match accordingly, the string is symmetrical; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis code will check both properties (symmetrical and palindrome) for the provided strings and print the results as per the examples given in your task.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:16:13.256Z"}
