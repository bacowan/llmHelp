{"level":"info","message":"To achieve the task of finding the power of a number using recursion, let's modify the code accordingly. The basic idea behind recursion for calculating the power of a number involves multiplying the number by itself and decreasing the power by 1 until the power reaches 0. When the power is 0, the result should be 1 (since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1).\n\nHere is how we can implement this using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef pow(n, p):\n    # Base case: when p is 0, n^0 equals 1\n    if p == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: multiply n by the result of n raised to the power of (p-1)\n    return n * pow(n, p-1)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(pow(2, 3))  # Output: 8\nprint(pow(5, 2))  # Output: 25\n```\n\nIn this recursive approach:\n- The function `pow` is called with the original values of `n` and `p`.\n- If `p` is 0, the base case is triggered, and the function returns 1.\n- If `p` is not 0, the function calls itself (`pow(n, p-1)`) and multiplies the result by `n`.\n- This process continues until `p` reaches 0, at which point the recursion unwinds and the final result is computed.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-03T10:06:49.941Z"}
