{"level":"info","message":"1: Exactly, you've implemented an iterative approach using a loop instead of a recursive one. Let's refocus on the problem at hand, which is to implement this using recursion.\n\nTo reframe your solution into a recursive approach, we need to consider how to break the problem down. Can you think of a base case for exponentiation? What would the power function return for `P = 0`? How about for `P = 1`?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:27:36.936Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"2: I see, you mean the code correctly calculates the power but uses a loop rather than recursion. Why do you think using recursion might be beneficial for this problem?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:27:37.817Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"3: Ah, I see. You’ve implemented the power function iteratively using a loop. Let's look at how we can refactor this to use recursion instead. \n\nCan you explain why you opted for a loop in your initial implementation?

{"level":"info","message":"That's a good observation! So, let me ask you, why did you choose to use a loop to implement the power function instead of using recursion? Can you elaborate on your thought process behind this implementation?","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:27:40.040Z"}

{"level":"info","message":"1: Absolutely, let's think this through together. You mentioned that you want to implement this using recursion. To move in that direction, let's start by understanding how recursion works. \n\nCan you explain to me what a base case and a recursive case are in a recursive function? How might these concepts apply in the context of calculating the power of a number?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:27:48.531Z"}

{"level":"info","message":"Of course! Let's walk through how you might approach this problem using recursion. Recursion involves a function calling itself with a adjusted parameter until a base case is met.\n\nLet's start by thinking: What would be the base case for a recursive power function? For example, if you think about calculating something like `N^0`, what should the result always be?\n\nAnd then, if we have a way to progressively reduce the problem size, how do we adjust the parameters in our recursive call to get closer to that base case?\n\nThink about these questions and let's discuss your thought process.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:27:50.809Z"}
