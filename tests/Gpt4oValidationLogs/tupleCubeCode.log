{"level":"info","message":"1: Alright, let's continue to explore this together.\n\nYou mentioned that you're not getting the expected result. Let's begin by re-examining what is expected. According to the problem, you need a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is the number itself, and the second element is the cube of the number.\n\nLet's take a closer look at this line one more time:\n```python\nres = [(val, val * 3) for val in list1]\n```\n\nYou realized that multiplying a number by 3 does not compute its cube, right?\n\nSo, tell me, how can you mathematically represent the cube of a number in Python?

{"level":"info","message":"2: Of course! I won't give you an explicit solution, but let's work through this together.\n\nLet's revisit the requirements: you need to create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a number from the original list as the first element and the cube of that number as the second element. \n\nImagine the number in the list is `n`. How would you mathematically express the cube of `n`?\n\nOnce you have that answer, how could you adjust your code to reflect that calculation instead of using `val * 3`?\n\nAs a starting point, think about this: what operator or function in Python can be used to calculate the power of a number?\n\nFeel free to elaborate on what you think, and we'll refine it from there!","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:45:53.853Z"}
