{"level":"info","message":"2: Sure! Let's continue to walk through the process so you can arrive at the solution yourself. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Nested Loops**: You used two `for` loops to iterate through both lists. What happens to the `result` variable every time you check an element from `list1` against each element of `list2`?\n\n2. **Early Termination**: When you find a common element, do you think it would be efficient to continue checking the remaining elements? What should happen if you find a match?\n\n3. **Logic of Comparison**: Each time a mismatch is found (`x != y`), the `result` is set to `False`. What effect does this have on the final value of `result` when iterating through all elements?\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. In the code you have written, every time a mismatch (`else` block) occurs between elements from `list1` and `list2`, `result` is being set to `False`. This means that even if a match was found earlier and `result` was set to `True`, it could immediately be set back to `False` in subsequent iterations.\n\n2. Instead of iterating through all elements even after finding a common one, think about how you could stop the iteration as soon as a match is found. \n\n3. To simplify this, consider using a different approach, maybe with set operations which are designed to handle these types of membership checks efficiently.\n\nGiven these points, try rewriting your function with these considerations in mind. Think about how you can check for commonality without unnecessary iterations and changes to the `result` variable. Can you come up with a streamlined approach?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:34:06.937Z"}

Let's focus on your use of the `result` variable.

{"level":"info","message":"Let's take a step back and analyze what our goal is. We're trying to determine if there is at least one common element in the two lists. \n\nLooking at your code, you have two nested loops: one iterates through `list1`, and for each element in `list1`, the other iterates through `list2`.
