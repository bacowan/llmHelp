{"level":"info","message":"1: That's a great observation. So, your current implementation uses a loop to calculate the power. Could you explain why you chose to use a loop instead of recursion for this task?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:24.354Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"2: You're right that your current implementation uses iteration rather than recursion. Let's delve into that a bit. To begin, could you explain how your for loop operates to calculate the power of a number? This will help us better understand your approach.","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:25.402Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"3: Ah, I see. You mentioned that your implementation works but isn't using recursion. Recursion can often simplify problems where a task can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-tasks. \n\nSo, let me ask you: why do you think iterative loops might not be the best choice for this problem? How might recursion provide a more elegant or effective solution for calculating powers?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:27.007Z"}

{"level":"info","message":"1: Of course, let's dive into that together. What's the main difference between iterating through a loop and using a recursive function? Can you recall any key concepts or characteristics that define recursion?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:47.483Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"2: Of course, I'd be happy to help! Let's think about the process of calculating the power of a number using recursion. \n\nHow do you think you would describe the power function \\(N^P\\) in terms of smaller subproblems? Specifically, if you knew the result of \\(N^{P-1}\\), how could you use that to find the result of \\(N^P\\)?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:49.087Z"}
{"level":"info","message":"3: Sure, let's work through this together. When we talk about recursion, we mean a function that calls itself. Can you think of how we might break down the problem of finding \\( N^P \\) into smaller subproblems that could utilize a function calling itself?","tags":"consensus-response","timestamp":"2024-06-01T07:26:51.404Z"}
