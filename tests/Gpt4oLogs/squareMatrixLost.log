This part seems like it aims to create an n x n matrix with numbers from 1 to n^2.\n\n    ```python\n    temp = itertools.count(1)\n    l = [next(temp) for i in range(n)]\n    ```\n\n    Could you explain why you used `itertools.count` in combination with `next(temp)` and how this contributes to creating an n x n matrix?\n\n2. **Reversing Alternate Rows**: You have a condition for reversing alternate rows when `n` is even. You mentioned that this is to ensure all diagonal elements are either all even or all odd.\n\n    ```python\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        for i in range(len(l)):\n            if i % 2 == 1:\n                l[i][:] = l[i][::-1]\n    ```\n\n    Can you elaborate on how reversing alternate rows helps achieve the condition of having even sums for opposite corners in every sub-matrix?\n\n3. **Printing the Array**: Finally, you have a nested loop to print the array.\n\n    ```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            print(l[i][j], end=\" \")\n        print()\n    ```\n\n    Does this piece of code correctly iterate over the supposed n x n matrix?\n\nLet's try to break it down and understand where there might be issues.
