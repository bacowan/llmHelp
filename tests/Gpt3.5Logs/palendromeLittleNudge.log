{"level":"info","message":"Checking if both halves of the string are the same is important because symmetry means that one half is a mirror image of the other. If the two halves are not the same, then the string cannot be considered symmetrical. It's like comparing both sides of a face - if they don't match up, then the face is not symmetrical. So, by comparing both halves of the string, we can determine if it exhibits symmetry.\nPlease keep helping me, and remember to act as a teacher: don't give me any explicit answers or code.","tags":"prompt","timestamp":"2024-04-28T09:27:14.544Z"}
