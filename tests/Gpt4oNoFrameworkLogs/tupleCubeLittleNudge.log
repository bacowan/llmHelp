{"level":"info","message":"It looks like there's a small mistake in your code. In the list comprehension, you mistakenly used `val * 3` instead of `val ** 3` to calculate the cube of the number. The `val * 3` operation multiplies the number by 3, not cubing it. \n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]\n\n# using list comprehension to iterate each\n# values in list and create a tuple as specified\nres = [(val, val ** 3) for val in list1]\n\n# print the result\nprint(res)\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected result:\n```python\n[(1, 1), (2, 8), (5, 125), (6, 216)]\n```","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:15:57.856Z"}
