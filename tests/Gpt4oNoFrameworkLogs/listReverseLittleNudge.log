{"level":"info","message":"It looks like you are getting an error because the variable `size` is not defined in your function. You'll need to get the length of `newList` and store it in `size`. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef swapList(newList):\n    size = len(newList)  # Get the length of the list\n    \n    if size < 2:  # Check if the list contains less than 2 elements\n        return newList  # If yes, return the original list\n\n    temp = newList[0]\n    newList[0] = newList[size - 1]\n    newList[size - 1] = temp\n\n    return newList\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(swapList([12, 35, 9, 56, 24]))  # Output: [24, 35, 9, 56, 12]\nprint(swapList([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [3, 2, 1]\nprint(swapList([1]))  # Output: [1]\n```\n\nThis corrected code should work for lists of any length, including those with fewer than two elements.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:01:37.254Z"}
