{"level":"info","message":"The provided code has several issues. Specifically, it does not generate a complete `n x n` matrix and does not ensure that the sums of opposite corners are even in all submatrices. To meet these requirements, we need a different approach.\n\nHere is an implementation that achieves the task:\n\n```python\ndef generate_even_submatrix(n):\n    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    current_even = 2\n    current_odd = 1\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:  # Places with even indices sum\n                matrix[i][j] = current_odd\n                current_odd += 2\n            else:  # Places with odd indices sum\n                matrix[i][j] = current_even\n                current_even += 2\n    \n    return matrix\n\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\n# Example usage:\nn = int(input(\"Enter the size of the matrix: \"))\nmatrix = generate_even_submatrix(n)\nprint_matrix(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code works by filling the matrix such that:\n- The sum of indices for opposite corners (i.e., (i, j) and (n-i-1, n-j-1) for any submatrix) is even.\n- All elements in positions where the sum of indices is even contain odd numbers.\n- All elements in positions where the sum of indices is odd contain even numbers.\n\nThis ensures that for any submatrix:\n1. The sum of the top-left and bottom-right corner elements is the sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers, both cases yielding an even sum.\n2. Similarly, the sum of the top-right and bottom-left corner elements will also be even.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:10:48.355Z"}
