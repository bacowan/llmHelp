{"level":"info","message":"The issue with your code is that you continue the nested loop even after finding a common element, potentially overwriting `result` back to `False`. You should return immediately once you find a common element. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef common_data(list1, list2):\n    # traverse in the 1st list\n    for x in list1:\n        # traverse in the 2nd list\n        for y in list2:\n            # if one common\n            if x == y:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can make your function more efficient by using the set intersection approach, which simplifies the code and improves performance:\n\n```python\ndef common_data(list1, list2):\n    return bool(set(list1) & set(list2))\n```\n\nHere's how both work:\n\n1. **Nested Loop Approach**:\n    - Traverse through each element in `list1`.\n    - For each element in `list1`, traverse through each element in `list2`.\n    - If a common element is found, return `True`.\n    - If the loop completes without finding a common element, return `False`.\n\n2. **Set Intersection Approach**:\n    - Convert both lists to sets.\n    - Return `True` if the intersection (`&`) of the sets is not empty.\n    - Return `False` otherwise. \n\nEither approach will provide the correct results for checking if two lists have at least one element in common.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:07:15.379Z"}
