{"level":"info","message":"It looks like the issue is with the expression used to compute the second element of the tuple in the list comprehension. The expression `(val * 3)` is incorrect because it multiplies the value by 3 instead of finding its cube.\n\nYou need to change `(val * 3)` to `(val ** 3)` to get the cube of the number.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\nlist1 = [1, 2, 5, 6]\n \n# using list comprehension to iterate each\n# value in list and create a tuple as specified\nres = [(val, val ** 3) for val in list1]\n \n# print the result\nprint(res)\n```\n\nThis will give you the correct output:\n```\n[(1, 1), (2, 8), (5, 125), (6, 216)]\n```","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:14:46.214Z"}
