{"level":"info","message":"Understood! Instead of using a loop, we can use a recursive function to achieve the power calculation. Here's a recursive version of the `pow` function:\n\n```python\ndef pow(n, p):\n    # Base case: Any number to the power of 0 is 1\n    if p == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n^p = n * n^(p-1)\n    else:\n        return n * pow(n, p - 1)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(pow(2, 3))  # Output: 8\nprint(pow(5, 2))  # Output: 25\n```\n\nIn this code, the base case handles the situation where the power `P` is 0, returning 1. For any other value of `P`, the function multiplies `N` by the result of recursively calling itself with `P` decreased by one, thus reducing the problem step-by-step until it reaches the base case.","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-05-31T10:04:45.688Z"}
