Note: Should also do the same test as "validation", just to see how it behaves with the new framework and without the validation step.

Things I noticed:
GPT 4 seems to be much more verbose. I'd say it's better, but it's likely that the framework should be configurable for each LLM that it's built for.
Sometimes it lists all of the techniques it's using. This isn't a bad thing nessisarily, but makes it a little verbose.
In turn, responses felt slower
I feel like the responses are much more detailed, so whether responses are "useful" or not is really determined by the individual students
