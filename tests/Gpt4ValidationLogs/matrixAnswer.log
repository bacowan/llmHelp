Your task involves generating an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix with a very specific set of conditions about the sum of opposite corners in any sub-matrix being even. This isn't just about checking common data but about designing an algorithm that places numbers thoughtfully according to these rules.\n\nGiven that every number has to be used exactly once from 1 to \\(n^2\\), let's dive deeper with some guiding questions to construct a strategic approach to solve the problem without spoon-feeding the solution:\n\n1. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - Consider the property of even and odd numbers when added together. What do you notice about the sum of two odd numbers or two even numbers compared to the sum of an odd and an even number? How does this property influence the placement of numbers in the matrix to meet the condition about the sums of opposite corners?\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - Is there a way to systematically place numbers in the matrix so that every sub-matrix inherently satisfies the condition without having to check every possible sub-matrix explicitly? For example, think about alternating patterns, or how chess boards are arranged. \n\n3. **Algorithmic Approach**:\n   - How might you start filling in the matrix to ensure compliance with the rules? Would you begin with a specific quadrant, or use a spiral approach, or maybe there's a linear way to fill in that automatically satisfies the conditions for every possible sub-matrix?\n\n4. **Decomposition**:\n   - Can this problem be broken down into simpler, more manageable tasks? For instance, filling the matrix with numbers from 1 to \\(n^2\\) without considering the condition, and then possibly rearranging or swapping numbers according to some logical pattern that emerges?\n\n5. **Iteration and Refinement**:\n   - Once you have a preliminary method for creating the matrix, how could you test it for smaller values of \\(n\\) to ensure it meets the criteria for all sub-matrices? Can you refine your approach based on these tests?\n\nRemember, the goal here isn't to jump straight to a solution but to develop a methodical approach that satisfies the problem conditions naturally as you build the matrix.

{"level":"info","message":"2: Let's take a step back and dissect the challenge and your code to understand why it isn't achieving the desired outcome. We're dealing with a complex problem that demands a matrix to be filled with distinct integers from 1 to \\(n^2\\) in such a way that every sub-matrix has even sums for the opposite corners. Reviewing your code and the problem statement, there are several areas we need to scrutinize and rethink together:\n\n1. **Matrix Generation Logic:**\n   - Your current method initializes a list with consecutive numbers up to \\(n\\) and then attempts to reverse alternate rows for even-dimension matrices. Considering the complexity of ensuring that all sub-matrices meet the even-sum condition for their diagonal counterparts, is this approach comprehensive enough to cover all potential sub-matrices? Reflect on how the arrangement of numbers from 1 to \\(n^2\\) affects the sum of the diagonals in sub-matrices.\n\n2. **Even Sum Property Clarification:**\n   - To reinforce understanding, remember that for any two integers, their sum is even if both are even or both are odd. Given this, how might arranging these integers in rows and columns ensure that any sub-matrix selected adheres to this rule? Think about the implications for where even and odd numbers should be placed relative to each other in the grid.\n\n3. **Implementation Rework:**\n   - It seems there was a misunderstanding in translating the requirement into the implementation. For a start, look at how you're generating the matrix; `l = [next(temp) for i in range(n)]` only creates a single list of numbers from 1 to \\(n\\), not a \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. How might you adjust this to generate a full \\(n \\times n\\) grid in a way that respects the condition for even sums in sub-matrices?\n\n4. **Pattern and Distribution:**\n   - To address the even sum condition effectively, consider how you can leverage patterns. For instance, one potential strategy could involve mapping even and odd numbers in a checkerboard pattern or another systematic arrangement. How can such a pattern be achieved programmatically? How does this pattern impact the relationship between numbers in sub-matrices?\n\n5. **Algorithmic Rectification:**\n   - Given that your current approach might not be fulfilling the problem's conditions entirely, how could you reinvent your strategy to ensure every sub-matrix obeys the rules? Think about the foundational steps to create a \\(n \\times n\\) matrix and consider alternate ways to populate it that inherently satisfy the condition about even sums. \n\nBased on these pointers, try to re-imagine your approach by focusing on generating a matrix that adheres to the problem conditions from the ground up, rather than attempting to transform a simple sequence-generated matrix after the fact. Consider how numbers can be placed in the matrix in a way that inherently ensures all sub-matrices will have even-sum diagonals, keeping in mind the parity (odd or even nature) of each number's placement.\n\nRemember, tackling this problem is a great opportunity to dwell deeper into algorithmic thinking and pattern recognition.

The condition is that for any sub-matrix, the sum of the opposite corners must be even. This implies a careful arrangement of odd and even numbers within the matrix. Given this premise:\n\n1. **Understanding Number Patterns**:\n   - Reflecting on the condition for even sums (two even numbers or two odd numbers), how might aligning odd and even numbers in a structured pattern help meet this condition across the entire matrix?\n\n2. **Matrix Generation Strategy**:\n   - Considering the need to place numbers from 1 to \\(n^2\\) in a way that every possible sub-matrix meets the even-sum condition, what sort of pattern (alternating odd and even numbers, blocks of odds and evens, diagonal lines, etc.) could potentially satisfy this condition? How does this impact your initial matrix generation logic?\n\n3. **Revisiting Code Implementation**:\n   - Your initial approach seems to focus on altering rows for a matrix of even order. Could this strategy be missing a deeper structural requirement? Given that the sum of opposite corners’ condition must hold for all possible sub-matrices, not just individual rows or columns, how might your approach to generating and arranging the matrix need to change?\n\n4. **Algorithm Adjustment**:\n   - It's crucial to step back and reassess: Is there a fundamental pattern that can be applied universally to matrices of any size (n x n) to achieve the goal? How can the sequence of placing numbers 1 through \\(n^2\\) be structured from the outset to ensure the even-sum condition is universally applied?\n\n5. **Verification and Testing**:\n   - Once you adjust your strategy, think about how you could test small cases (e.g., 2x2, 3x3 matrices) manually to verify the condition holds. Can you devise a simple method or a quick check to confirm the even-sum condition for sub-matrices in larger, more complex matrices?\n\nRemember, solving complex problems often requires iterative problem-solving and sometimes stepping away from the initial specifics of code implementation to revisit the underpinning logic of the challenge. Reflecting on these points could unveil a pathway towards adjusting your code or entirely rethinking the strategy to ensure it aligns with the task's objectives. \n\nHow could you leverage mathematical patterns or sequences to systematically fulfill the condition without having to manually adjust individual elements?

The emphasis here will be on understanding how to structure this arrangement and the logic behind it.\n\n**Conceptual Breakdown:**\n1. **Understanding Even and Odd Sums:**\n    - Recall that the sum of two numbers is even if both are even or both are odd.

How might this analogy help in conceptualizing the arrangement of numbers to satisfy the stated condition?\n\n3. **Concrete Strategy Development:**\n    - Given that the condition must apply to every possible sub-matrix, think about the significance of the matrix's rows and columns in forming these sub-matrices.

How does this setup influence the placement of subsequent numbers?\n\n5. **Evaluation and Adjustment:**\n    - After conceptualizing a potential arrangement strategy, think about how you could validate whether it meets the condition. Since manually checking each possible sub-matrix isn't feasible for larger matrices, is there a logical proof or rationale you could apply to confirm that your arrangement strategy inherently satisfies the condition for all sub-matrices?\n\nBy focusing on these facets, the aim is to encourage a deep dive into the underlying principles guiding the solution to this problem.

This principle is crucial. For a square matrix where this rule must apply to all sub-matrices, how should even and odd numbers be placed relative to each other?\n\n2. **Matrix Formation Insight:**\n    - **Reflection:** Given the need for distinct elements ranging from 1 to \\(n^2\\), it's crucial to consider the implications of alternating sequences or patterns. If you were to sketch a matrix with alternating even and odd numbers, what pattern emerges for \\(n \\times n\\) matrices, especially for even vs odd values of \\(n\\)?\n\n3. **Strategizing for Sub-matrices:**\n    - **Critical Thinking:** Every sub-matrix must also fulfill the even sum condition for opposite corners. If you were to take a smaller, 2x2 matrix as a basic example, how must the elements be arranged? How does this arrangement extend to larger matrices and their sub-matrices?\n\n4. **Implementation Strategy:**\n    - **Logical Progression:** Considering the arrangement of even and odd numbers, think about how a 2D array is formed. Start from a 1x1 matrix and expand your thought process up to 2x2, 3x3, and so on. How does the introduction of each new row and column impact your ability to maintain the even sum condition?\n\n### Navigating Through Solution Path:\n\n- **Pattern Recognition:** Is there a discernible pattern in placing even and odd numbers that satisfies the condition across the entire matrix and all possible sub-matrices? Think about how the sequence or arrangement of these numbers could provide a key to solving the puzzle.\n\n- **Matrix Integrity:** Reflect on how the integrity of the pattern you identify can be maintained as the matrix expands. What happens when you move from an odd-sized matrix to an even-sized one, and vice versa? Does the pattern hold, or need adjustment?\n\n### Reflect and Iterate:\n\n- As you consider these elements, think about the matrix in layers or sections. How does treating the matrix as a collection of layers, or even visualizing it in terms of its quadrants, help in maintaining the balance between even and odd placements?\n\n- **Implementation Reflection:** Revisit your method for generating the matrix and populating it with values. How can you modify this process to align with the conceptual understanding you've now developed about the matrix structure required to meet the problem's conditions?\n\nBy internalizing these questions and walking through them systematically, you can refine your approach to creating an Even Sub-Matrix.
