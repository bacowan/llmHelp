{"level":"info","message":"Let's take a closer look at your approach to solving the problem. You've used list comprehension effectively to iterate over each value in the list, which is a great method. Now, for each value `val` in `list1`, you've created a tuple where the first element is `val`, and the second element is `val * 3`. Given the task was to find the cube of each number (where cubing a number means multiplying it by itself three times), could you reflect on whether multiplying the value by 3 gives you the cube of the number?
