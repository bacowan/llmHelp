{"level":"info","message":"Let's look at how the logic in your code unfolds. During the nested loop iteration, whenever a match is found between an element in list1 and an element in list2, you're setting `result` to `True`, which is correct as per the objective to find at least one common element. However, consider what happens next. If, after finding a match, the loops continue and the next elements do not match, you're setting `result` back to `False`.\n\nCould this approach of setting `result` to `False` within the inner loop—after potentially setting it to `True`—affect the final outcome even if there was a match found earlier? How might the logic be adjusted so that once a match is found and `result` is set to `True`, it reflects accurately that at least one common element has been found, without being overridden by subsequent non-matching pairs?","tags":"response","timestamp":"2024-04-29T11:34:11.133Z"}
