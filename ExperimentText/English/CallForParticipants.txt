Dear Students,

We invite students to take part in a research experiment designed to test a framework aimed at assisting programming students to learn while completing assignments. Those who participate will be given a small gift.

Overview:
The experiment consists of two parts:
    1. Take a short test on your own time (approximately 10 minutes).
    2. Attend a 20 minute in-person session in the Research Quadrangles, where you will complete programming problems with the help of a ChatGPT-backed plugin, take another quiz, and fill out a survey.

How to Participate:
    1. Follow this link to reserve a slot: [link]
    2. Navigate to the week of [date] and select a slot on the calendar for part 2 of the experiment.
    3. Once selected, you will receive instructions on how to complete Part 1, which should be done at least one week before your scheduled appointment.
    4. On the day of the appointment, arrive on time at the designated location.
