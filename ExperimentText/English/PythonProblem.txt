Implement a simple system to transfer funds between two bank accounts: using the given BankAccount class, finish the given `transfer_funds` function (feel free to add code outside of the `transfer_funds` function, but do not edit the `get_balance` or `set_balance` methods). The transfer_funds function should subtract the amount to transfer from account_from's balance and add it to account_to's balance. The `transfer_funds` function should be thread safe. Note that you should not call the `balance` member variable directly, but instead use the provided getter and setter.

import threading
import time

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def get_balance(self):
        ret = self.balance
        # simulate network delay
        time.sleep(1)
        return ret

    def set_balance(self, val):
        self.balance = val

def transfer_funds(account_from, account_to, amount):
    pass
